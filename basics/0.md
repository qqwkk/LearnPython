# VARIABLES

## INTS/FLOATS

 **"Variables"** sounds like some complicated thing but it is one of the fundimentals of a modern programming language.
 Variables are like algebra such as:

`x = 5`

but can have more detailed names like:

`player_points = 13`



Like algebra, we can do things to variables once we have created them.

`player_points += 1`

this adds one to `player_points`

Here is a list of operands:

- `+=` **add**
- `-=` **minus**
- `*=` **times**
- `**=` **power** *(like square `5 ** 2 = 25`)*
- `/=` **divide**
- `//=` **floor divide** *(divide and round down no matter what)*
  
  

These type of number variables are called either:

**ints** *(normal numbers)* or **floats** *(decimals)*



But there are other types of variables, such as:

## STRINGS

Strings are defined the same as ints and floats but with speech marks **(IT DOESN'T MATTER WHICH YOU USE)**

`my_text = "Hello, World"`

or inverted commas

`my_text = 'Hello, World'`



We can also add strings together using `+`

`'Hello, ' + 'World! By ' + mytext`

Or if you want to get fancy use an **FSTRING**

Like so:

`f'Hello, World! By {mytext}'`

(Here im using `{}` to add a variable to the text. This is **better** because you dont have to worry about **type errors**.)



These both output the same things.

Speaking of which, **how do we output?**

To output we use a:

## BUILT IN

These are built in functions that are very useful.

**NOTE:** Here the outputs will be shown as if they were printed and shown like this: `// output`

Such as:

- `print('Hello, World!')` *(SHOWS TEXT)*
`// Hello, World!`
- `enumerate(['John', 'Bob', 'Lucas'])` *(LIST OF TUPLES = (INDEX, ITEM))*
`// [(0, 'John'
- `float('2.5')` *(TURNS INPUT INTO FLOAT)*
- `input('What is your name? )` *(RETURNS USER INPUT)*
- `int('3')` *(TURNS INPUT INTO INT)*
- `len(['John', 'Bob', 'Lucas'])` *(RETURNS LENGTH OF INPUT)*
- `list('abc')` *(TURNS INPUT INTO LIST)*
- `range(3)` *(USED IN FOR LOOPS)*
- `round(3.14159, 2)` *(ROUNDS TO FIRST INPUT TO (THE SECOND INPUT) DECIMAL PLACES)*
- `str(4)` *(TURNS INPUT INTO STRING)*
- `type('Hello')` *(RETURNS THE TYPE OF INPUT)*
